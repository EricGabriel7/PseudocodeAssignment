Declare rainfall as a number
Declare roof height as a number
Declare roof width as a number
Declare roof area as roof width x roof height
Declare roof area_inches as roof area x 12

DOWHILE it is raining
	Get roof width
	Get roof height
	Calculate roof area
	Calculate roof area_inches
	Get rainfall
	Multiply roof area_inches by rainfall, define result as rainfall_volume
	Divide rainfall_volume by 231, define this as rainfall_volume_gallons
	Print rainfall_volume_gallons
ENDDO

Test data: with example data

Declare rainfall as a number
Declare roof height as a number
Declare roof width as a number
Declare roof area as roof width x roof height
Declare roof area_inches as roof area x 12

It is raining, so proceed with statement
	Roof width is 50''
	Roof height is 20''
	Roof area is 50'x 20'
	Roof area_inches is 600''x 240''
	Rainfall is 1''
	rainfall_volume = 600''x 240'' x 1'' = 144,000
	rainfall_volume_gallons = 144,000/231= 623.38
	Print rainfall_volume_gallons = 623.38 

	Test data: other data set
	
Declare rainfall as a number
Declare roof height as a number
Declare roof width as a number
Declare roof area as roof width x roof height
Declare roof area_inches as roof area x 12

It is raining, proceed with statement
	Roof width is 13''
	Roof height is 17''
	Roof area is 13' x 17'
	Roof area_inches 156'' x 204''
	Rainfall is 8''
	rainfall_volume = 156''x 204'' x 8'' = 254,592
	rainfall_volume_gallons = 254,592/231= 1102.13
	Print rainfall_volume_gallons =1102.13
